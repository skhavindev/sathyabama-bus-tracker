# Notification Sounds

Add a notification sound file named `notification.mp3` to this directory.

You can:
1. Use a free sound from https://freesound.org/
2. Create your own using audio editing software
3. Use a simple beep sound

The sound should be:
- Short (1-2 seconds)
- Clear and attention-grabbing
- Not too loud or jarring
- MP3 format

For now, the app will work without the sound file, but you'll see an error in the console when notifications are triggered.
